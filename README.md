# Isomorphism

Prove that if two graphs $A$ and $B$ have the same number of nodes and are
completely connected, they must be isomorphic. I have started with the formal
definition of isomorphism below. Add your answer to this markdown file. [This
page](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/working-with-advanced-formatting/writing-mathematical-expressions)
might help with the notation for mathematical expressions.

$G_1=(V_1 , E_1)$ is isomorphic to $G_2 = (V_2, E_2)$ if there exists a
one-to-one and onto function (bijection) $f: V_1 \rightarrow V_2$ such that $(u,v)
\in E_1$ iff $(f(u),f(v)) \in E_2$.

With this formal definition, two graphs are isomorphic if and only if they have the same vertices and edges, and they are connected in the same ways. So, if A is G1 and B is G2, lets say they each have 5 vertices and 5 edges so, A = (5, 5) and B = (5,5). Since they have the same amount of vertices, they have a bijection of $f: 5 \rightarrow 5$, such that $(u,v) \in 5$ since $(f(u),f(v)) \in 5$. Hence these two graphs are isomorphic.

I used the class slides on graphing.
