# Isomorphism

Prove that if two graphs $A$ and $B$ have the same number of nodes and are
completely connected, they must be isomorphic. I have started with the formal
definition of isomorphism below. Add your answer to this markdown file. [This
page](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/working-with-advanced-formatting/writing-mathematical-expressions)
might help with the notation for mathematical expressions.

$G_1=(V_1 , E_1)$ is isomorphic to $G_2 = (V_2, E_2)$ if there exists a
one-to-one and onto function (bijection) $f: V_1 \rightarrow V_2$ such that $(u,v)
\in E_1$ iff $(f(u),f(v)) \in E_2$.

So, with the definition, A and B are isomophic when they have the same structure of 
having the same amoung of nodes and are connected. This is becuase if a graph has a node
that is connected to another node, no matter how they cross over or the connection
lays in any way, it still has the same structure. A structure can only change when it 
has additional or less nodes or if a node is not connected to another node. Hence, A
and B with these fulfilled properties in the definition must be isomorphic.

I used the class slides on graphing.
