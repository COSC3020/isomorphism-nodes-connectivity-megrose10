# Isomorphism

Prove that if two graphs $A$ and $B$ have the same number of nodes and are
completely connected, they must be isomorphic. I have started with the formal
definition of isomorphism below. Add your answer to this markdown file. [This
page](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/working-with-advanced-formatting/writing-mathematical-expressions)
might help with the notation for mathematical expressions.

$G_1=(V_1 , E_1)$ is isomorphic to $G_2 = (V_2, E_2)$ if there exists a
one-to-one and onto function (bijection) $f: V_1 \rightarrow V_2$ such that $(u,v)
\in E_1$ iff $(f(u),f(v)) \in E_2$.

With this formal definition, two graphs are isomorphic if and only if they have the same vertices and edges, and they are connected in the same ways. So, when looking at two graphs, A and B, which have the same number of nodes and are completely connected, we can start our checks. We first will look at each pairing, making sure where there is a connection with two vertices on one, this can transfer to the other graph. Like if A has a connection between X and Y, and B has a connection between C and D, with a simple changing of the names, these would be isomorphic since they only have one transformation. 

I used the class slides on graphing. I also got help from the TA in lab.
